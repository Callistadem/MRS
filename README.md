3. Migrating the database:
```
# execute in backend/
php artisan migrate
```

### Database seeding
In case you want to start with a test user.
```
# execute in backend/
php artisan db:seed
```

### start backend
```
# execute in backend/
./vendor/bin/sail up mysql phpmyadmin -d 
php artisan serve
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
The default port 8000.

## Testing:

For coverage value analysis install:
- [php-pcov](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov/blob/develop/INSTALL.md)

### Backend and API tests

Ensure that the database is running.
```
# execute in backend/
php artisan migrate --database=testing
php artisan test
```
For coverage analysis execute:
```
php artisan test --coverage
```


## Additional information

### How to view database using phpMyAdmin:
The default setting is:
1. go to [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
2. login with credentials in `.env` file (default username=`root`, empty password)

### OpenAPI api specification
To test out the API through the openAPI specification 
1. Either go to `https://editor.swagger.io/` and open apispec.yml.\
Or\
Install the Swagger Viewer vscode extension (testing might not work)\
2. change the `cors.php` file located in `backend/config/` and change the `'allowed_origins'` value to `'allowed_origins' => ['*']`.\
This allows any location to send requests to your backend. For security reasons, set the value back to your frontend url.


## Testing
You can test the api if you have the backend and database running.


### Mailing
This application has the capability to automatically send emails to reporters who choose to receive so. To enable this a mailing host is required. To enable mailing please set the correct values in the `.env` file for `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`,`MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD` corresponding to those of your host.
